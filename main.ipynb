      "#### **Key Highlights**  \n",
      "1. **Tesla Advances Robotaxi Plans in Texas**  \n",
      "   - Tesla secured a rideshare permit in Texas, marking a step toward deploying autonomous robotaxis. The move aligns with its push into AI-driven mobility services. Texas‚Äôs favorable regulations and existing Tesla infrastructure make it a strategic testing ground.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Tesla Faces Shareholder Lawsuit Over Autonomous Tech Claims**  \n",
      "   - A class-action lawsuit alleges Tesla misled investors about its self-driving technology risks between 2023‚Äì2025. Investors are urged to contact Levi & Korsinsky before the October 2025 deadline. The case adds to Tesla‚Äôs legal challenges tied to its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving systems.  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Nvidia Hits Record High on AI Momentum**  \n",
      "   - Nvidia‚Äôs stock surged, fueled by OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-5 launch (citing Nvidia as a partner) and Tesla‚Äôs pivot to rely on Nvidia/AMD for AI chips instead of in-house development. Shares rose 0.8%, with analysts bullish on its dominance in AI training hardware.  \n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Tesla‚Äôs Stock Recovers After Dojo Team Shakeup**  \n",
      "   - Despite the departure of Dojo AI chief Peter Bannon, Tesla‚Äôs stock climbed 1.8%. Elon Musk confirmed a shift toward inference-optimized chips (AI5/AI6), downplaying Dojo‚Äôs role. Analysts remain split on Tesla‚Äôs AI strategy, but Morgan Stanley values its potential at $500B.  \n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Trump‚Äôs CEO Feuds: From Musk to Intel**  \n",
      "   - President Trump‚Äôs criticism of Intel‚Äôs CEO over China ties mirrors past clashes with corporate leaders, including Tesla‚Äôs Musk (on subsidies) and Apple‚Äôs Cook (on tariffs). The pattern reflects Trump‚Äôs confrontational stance on business policies.  \n",
      "\n",
      "6. **China‚Äôs EV Growth Cools as Price Wars Ease**  \n",
      "   - July passenger car sales grew just 6.3% YoY, down from June‚Äôs 18%, as government interventions tempered price cuts. EV sales rose 12%, but Tesla‚Äôs China deliveries fell 8.4%. Exports surged, with NEV shipments more than doubling.  \n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Ex-Tesla Engineer Alleges Bias in Musk Defamation Case**  \n",
      "   - Cristina Balan challenges a 2021 arbitration loss, claiming the arbitrator favored Tesla in a ‚Äúrepeat player‚Äù conflict. The case, set for August 19, tests fairness in corporate arbitration‚Äîa recurring issue for Tesla.  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Market Sentiment**  \n",
      "- **Tesla**: Mixed reactions to robotaxis (bullish) vs. legal and leadership concerns (bearish).  \n",
      "- **Nvidia**: Unstoppable AI demand drives record highs; Tesla‚Äôs reliance bolsters its position.  \n",
      "- **China EV Market**: Slower growth signals a maturing sector, with Tesla losing ground domestically.  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Watch This Week**  \n",
      "- Tesla‚Äôs AI chip strategy post-Dojo.  \n",
      "- Nvidia‚Äôs performance amid AI boom.  \n",
